## 🖼️ Design Reference

Designs were provided in JPEG format by Frontend Mentor. Layout, typography, and spacing were interpreted with style-guide.md to match the design across resolutions.

## 📝 What I Learned

- Deepened understanding of React’s state flow and conditional rendering
- Experimented with advanced Tailwind techniques (responsive units, dynamic classes, custom cursor logic)
- Integrated Framer Motion for subtle UI feedback without over-complication
- Improved project structure for maintainability and scalability
